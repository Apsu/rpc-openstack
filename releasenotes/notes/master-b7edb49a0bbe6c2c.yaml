    Neutron has fixed bugs related to port-security,
    allowing it to be re-enabled.  Additionally
    handle_internal_only_routers now defaults to true,
    allowing us to remove the override.
features:
  - LBaaSv2 can now be configured via Horizon.
  - MTUs are now calculated correctly, overrides have
    been removed.
upgrade:
  - The default value for the arp-responder has changed
    when using ML2 and the Linux Bridge agent.  The
    logical network will now utilize traditional flood
    and learn through the overlay. When upgrading,
    existing vxlan devices will retain their old setup
    and be unimpacted by changes to this flag. To apply
    this to older devices created with the Liberty agent,
    the vxlan device must be removed and then the Mitaka
    agent restarted.  The agent will recreate the vxlan
    devices with the current settings upon restart.
  - The default_subnet_pools option is now deprecated and
    will be removed in the Newton release. The same
    functionality is now provided by setting is_default
    attribute on subnetpools to True using the API or
    client.
other:
  - Overlay networks are not explicitly required, if
    unset it will default to the ansible_ssh_host value.
